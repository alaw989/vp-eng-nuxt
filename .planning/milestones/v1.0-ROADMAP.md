# Milestone v1.0: VP Associates Website Modernization

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-02-06
**Phases:** 1-10
**Total Plans:** 55

## Overview

This milestone delivers a modern Nuxt 3 headless website that systematically improves the VP Associates web presence through methodical section-by-section refinement. Starting with comprehensive audit and baseline capture, we build comparison infrastructure and quality assurance foundations before migrating images and validating content integrity. The final phases focus on polishing each section (homepage, projects, services, about/team, contact/careers) with visual and functional parity against the live site.

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:** None

**Key Decisions:**
- Cheerio for XML parsing: lighter than xml2js, better API for sitemap scraping
- Sitemap index recursion: WordPress uses wp-sitemap.xml as index, sub-sitemaps for posts/pages
- Type-based classification: URLs normalized to slug/type for downstream baseline capture
- 85+ score targets (relaxed from roadmap's 90/95/100) per Phase 5 Context
- Graceful skip when Chrome unavailable (vs hard failure) for CI compatibility
- Parallax limited to first 100px of scroll to avoid excessive movement
- Zoom effect capped at 1.15x scale to prevent distortion
- Duration-300 for card hover transitions (consistent with Phases 6-9)
- Duration-200 for button/badge hover transitions (faster response)
- Group-hover pattern for parent-triggered child animations
- NuxtLink for client-side navigation (fixed Services link issue)
- JSON-LD schema wrapped in computed for reactive updates

**Issues Resolved:**
- Fixed context overflow with phase-based organization
- Resolved phase insertion confusion with decimal numbering
- Services navigation using `<a href>` instead of `<NuxtLink>` causing full page reload — FIXED
- JSON-LD composable causing SSR issues — FIXED with reactive computed wrapper
- Vue Router infinite redirect warnings — investigated, fixed useJsonld reactivity

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Some workflow templates have hardcoded paths (minor, can be addressed in future)

**Stats:**
- 10 phases
- 55 plans
- ~14,000 lines of Vue/TypeScript
- 34+ files modified
- 3 days execution (Feb 3-6, 2026)
