## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Heavy animation libraries (GSAP, Framer Motion) | Performance regression risk, 100KB+ bundle |
| Full page overhaul transitions | Disorienting, blocks interaction |
| Parallax scrolling | Performance killer, CLS issues |
| Auto-playing carousels | WCAG violation, motion sensitivity |
| Splash screens | Blocks content, delays engagement |
| Color-only state indicators | Color blindness accessibility issue |
