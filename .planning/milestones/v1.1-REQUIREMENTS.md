## v1.1 Requirements - COMPLETE

All performance optimization and WordPress API integration requirements have been completed.

### Measurement

- [x] **PERF-01**: Run Lighthouse audit to establish baseline scores across all pages
- [x] **PERF-02**: Perform bundle size analysis with rollup-plugin-visualizer
- [x] **PERF-03**: Identify LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) element for each route

**Outcome:** Baseline established. 608 KB total client JS with good chunk splitting. LCP elements identified for all routes.

### Critical Path Optimization

- [x] **PERF-04**: Implement critical CSS inlining to eliminate render-blocking styles
- [x] **PERF-05**: Optimize LCP images with eager loading and priority hints
- [x] **PERF-06**: Add preload hints for critical fonts and resources

**Outcome:** @nuxtjs/critters configured. Hero images use eager loading with fetchpriority. Font preload hints added.

### Code Optimization

- [x] **PERF-07**: Implement lazy loading for below-fold components
- [x] **PERF-08**: Implement lazy hydration for heavy components (hydrate-on-visible)
- [x] **PERF-09**: Remove unused CSS and JavaScript, analyze bundle
- [x] **PERF-10**: Implement server-side caching for API routes

**Outcome:** Lazy loading implemented for PageLoadingBar and other components. Server-side caching configured in nuxt.config.ts route rules.

### Navigation Fixes

- [x] **NAV-01**: Fix /careers route conflict (careers.vue → careers/index.vue)
- [x] **NAV-02**: Fix /services and /careers links to use NuxtLink (sitemap, header, footer)
- [x] **NAV-03**: Fix infinite redirect loop in routeRules (removed /services/ and /careers/ redirects)

**Outcome:** All navigation issues resolved. Client-side routing works correctly.

### Validation

- [x] **PERF-11**: Integrate Lighthouse CI with budget assertions
- [x] **PERF-12**: Verify Brotli compression is enabled in production
- [x] **PERF-13**: Verify cache headers are configured correctly

**Outcome:** lighthouserc.json created with budget assertions. Brotli and cache headers verified.

### WordPress API Integration

- [x] **WPAPI-01**: WordPress Custom Post Types registered with REST API enabled
- [x] **WPAPI-02**: Custom field meta boxes created for each CPT (using native custom fields)
- [x] **WPAPI-03**: Nuxt site successfully fetches and displays content from live WordPress API
- [x] **STYLE-01**: Circular elements render as perfect circles
- [x] **STYLE-02**: Testimonials display as single-row slider
- [x] **STYLE-03**: Hero section has gradient enhancement

**Outcome:** WordPress CPT plugin created. Live API integration complete. All styling improvements applied.

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Full page transitions | Blocks interaction, delays hydration |
| Heavy animation libraries | Massive JS payload, CLS risk |
| Aggressive prefetching | Can waste bandwidth, hurt LCP |
| Font self-hosting without optimization | Often slower than CDN |
| Universal/Bridge mode | Polyfill bloat, slower performance |
