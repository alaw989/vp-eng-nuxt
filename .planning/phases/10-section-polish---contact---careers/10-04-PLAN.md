<task type="auto">
  <name>Capture current screenshots for contact and careers pages</name>
  <files>.planning/scripts/capture-contact-careers-screenshots.ts</files>
  <action>
    Create screenshot capture script for contact and careers pages:

    1. Create .planning/scripts/capture-contact-careers-screenshots.ts:
       - Use Playwright for screenshot capture (same as Phase 7-4, 8-4, 9-4)
       - Define viewports: mobile (375px), tablet (768px), desktop (1920px)
       - Target URLs:
         * /contact - capture form section, info section, service areas
         * /careers - capture header, positions list, culture section
         * /careers/structural-engineer - capture detail page as example
       - Save to .planning/audit/current/{page}-{section}-{viewport}.png

    2. Screenshot sections to capture:
       Contact page:
       - contact-full (full page scroll capture)
       - contact-form (form section)
       - contact-info (contact info + map)

       Careers listing:
       - careers-full (full page)
       - careers-positions (open positions section)
       - careers-culture (culture section)

       Careers detail:
       - careers-detail-full (full page)
       - careers-detail-header (job header + apply button)
       - careers-detail-content (responsibilities, qualifications)

    3. Run the script:
       - npx tsx .planning/scripts/capture-contact-careers-screenshots.ts
       - Verify all screenshots captured successfully
       - Check file sizes are reasonable (not 0 bytes)

    DO NOT change:
    - Playwright configuration from Phase 2 infrastructure
    - Screenshot naming convention from prior phases

  <name>Run build verification and check for hydration errors</name>
  <files>pages/contact.vue, pages/careers.vue, pages/careers/[slug].vue</files>
  <action>
    Verify build and check for errors:

    1. Run production build:
       - npm run build
       - Check for TypeScript errors
       - Check for hydration errors in build output
       - Verify all pages build successfully

    2. Start preview server:
       - npm run preview (in background)
       - Wait for server to start (check for "Local: http://localhost" message)
       - Note: Port may vary - capture actual port from output

    3. Test pages in preview:
       - Visit http://localhost:{port}/contact
       - Visit http://localhost:{port}/careers
       - Visit http://localhost:{port}/careers/structural-engineer
       - Check console for errors
       - Verify no hydration mismatches

    4. Kill preview server:
       - Use pkill -f "nuxi preview" or similar
       - Verify process terminated

    5. Document build results:
       - Build time
       - Any warnings or errors
       - Hydration status (pass/fail)
       - Page load verification results

    DO NOT skip:
    - Build verification (catches TypeScript errors)
    - Hydration check (catches SSR mismatches)

    Create comprehensive verification report:

    1. Create .planning/phases/10-section-polish---contact---careers/10-04-VERIFICATION.md:
       - Document all 5 Phase 10 success criteria
       - Mark each as PASS or FAIL with evidence

    3. For each criterion:
       - Provide evidence (screenshot path, observation, test result)
       - Note any deviations or issues
       - Link to relevant files modified

    4. Summary section:
       - Overall status: X/5 PASS
       - Blockers (if any)
