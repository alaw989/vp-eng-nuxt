<objective>
Create Phase 17 VERIFICATION.md documenting accessibility compliance

Purpose: Phase 17 completed all 5 plans successfully but lacks a phase-level VERIFICATION.md. This document aggregates the accessibility compliance status, E2E test results, and requirement satisfaction evidence for milestone audit completeness.

Output: VERIFICATION.md file in Phase 17 directory

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create Phase 17 VERIFICATION.md</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/17-accessibility-foundation/17-VERIFICATION.md</files>
  <action>
Create a VERIFICATION.md file following the established format from Phase 18 verification.

Include:
1. **Frontmatter:**
   - phase: 17-accessibility-foundation
   - verified: current timestamp
   - status: passed
   - score: 9/9 requirements verified

2. **Goal Achievement section:**
   - Observable Truths table (5 success criteria from roadmap)
   - Each truth verified with evidence from SUMMARY files

3. **Required Artifacts section:**
   - composables/useA11y.ts (live regions)
   - tests-e2e/accessibility.spec.ts (E2E tests)
   - layouts/default.vue (skip link, ARIA regions)
   - components/AppHeader.vue (ARIA labels, keyboard nav)
   - components/AppFooter.vue (role="contentinfo")

4. **Requirements Coverage section (A11Y-01 through A11Y-09):**
   | Requirement | Status | Evidence |
   - A11Y-01: Skip link - SATISFIED
   - A11Y-02: ARIA labels - SATISFIED
   - A11Y-03: Keyboard navigation - SATISFIED
   - A11Y-04: Color contrast - SATISFIED (via Tailwind defaults)
   - A11Y-05: Alt text - SATISFIED
   - A11Y-06: Focus management - SATISFIED
   - A11Y-07: Semantic structure - SATISFIED
   - A11Y-08: Focus traps - SATISFIED
   - A11Y-09: Live regions - SATISFIED

5. **E2E Test Results section:**
   - Reference accessibility.spec.ts
   - 10 passing, 1 skipped (footer landmark timing)
   - Test-to-requirement mapping

6. **Known Limitations:**
   - Homepage h1 was missing (resolved by Phase 22 HeroStatic)
   - Footer landmark skipped in E2E (exists in HTML, Playwright timing issue)

7. **Gaps Summary:**
   - No gaps - all requirements satisfied
