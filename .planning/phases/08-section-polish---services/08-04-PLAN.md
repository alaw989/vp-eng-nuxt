<objective>
Capture screenshots of services pages, generate visual diffs against baseline, verify all Phase 8 success criteria with pass/fail report, and test micro-interaction functionality (hover effects, focus indicators, reduced motion support).

Purpose: Phase 8 completes with verification that all deliverables meet quality standards. Screenshot capture across mobile/tablet/desktop viewports documents current state. Visual diff generation identifies any regressions from baseline. Success criteria verification confirms all requirements met: listing page layout, detail page formatting, image migration, filtering functionality, visual parity, and micro-interaction enhancements from Phase 18.

Output: Verification report with 5/5 success criteria PASS, current screenshots of services pages, visual diff images showing no regressions, documented QA checkpoint approval, and confirmed micro-interaction functionality per Phase 18 patterns.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Create screenshot capture script for services pages</name>
  <files>.planning/scripts/capture-services-screenshots.ts</files>
  <action>
    Create .planning/scripts/capture-services-screenshots.ts to capture current services pages:

    1. Use Playwright for screenshot capture (already installed from Phase 7)

    2. Capture these URLs at 3 viewports (375px, 768px, 1920px):
       - /services (listing page with filters)
       - /services?category=structural (filtered view)
       - /services/structural-steel-design (detail with hero)
       - /services/concrete-design (detail with different hero)
       - /services/inspection-services (detail single-category)

    3. Save to .planning/audit/current/ with naming:
       services-listing-mobile.png
       services-listing-tablet.png
       services-listing-desktop.png
       services-filtered-mobile.png

       services-detail-inspection-mobile.png
       services-detail-inspection-tablet.png
       services-detail-inspection-desktop.png

    4. Script structure (similar to Phase 7 capture-projects-screenshots.ts):
       - Import Playwright
       - Define URLs and viewports
       - Launch browser, navigate to localhost:3000
       - Wait for page load (waitUntil: 'networkidle')
       - Capture screenshots
       - Close browser

    5. Create directory if not exists:
       await fs.promises.mkdir('.planning/audit/current', { recursive: true })
  </action>
  <verify>npx tsx .planning/scripts/capture-services-screenshots.ts, verify .planning/audit/current/ directory contains 15 screenshots (5 pages x 3 viewports)</verify>
  <done>Screenshot capture script created, 15 screenshots captured across mobile/tablet/desktop viewports for services listing page (filtered and unfiltered) and 3 representative detail pages</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Create visual diff generation script for services comparison</name>
  <files>.planning/scripts/compare-services-screenshots.ts</files>
  <action>
    Create .planning/scripts/compare-services-screenshots.ts to generate visual diffs:

    1. Use odiff for pixel-level comparison (already configured from Phase 7)

    2. Compare baseline screenshots (if exist) vs current:
       Baseline location: .planning/audit/baselines/services-*.png
       Current location: .planning/audit/current/services-*.png
       Diff output: .planning/audit/diffs/services-*-diff.png

    3. Script structure (similar to Phase 7 compare-projects-screenshots.ts):
       - Import fs, odiff from odiff-bin
       - Read baseline and current directories
       - Generate diffs for matching pairs
       - Output diff percentage for each comparison
       - Create diffs directory if not exists

    4. Handle case where baselines don't exist:
       - Log message: "No baseline found for {filename}, skipping diff"
       - Continue with other comparisons

    5. For baseline services screenshots, capture from live site if not already in .planning/audit/baselines/:
       - If .planning/audit/baselines/services-listing-desktop.png doesn't exist
       - Capture from https://vp-associates.com/services using Playwright
  </action>
  <verify>npx tsx .planning/scripts/compare-services-screenshots.ts, verify .planning/audit/diffs/ directory contains diff images for each baseline comparison</verify>
  <done>Visual diff script created, diff images generated for services pages compared against baseline, diff percentages logged for each comparison</done>

  <what-built>Complete Phase 8 implementation: category filter pills on listing page, hero images on detail pages, 4-step process section, dynamic related services, Phase 18 micro-interactions (hover states, focus indicators, reduced motion support), and verification report with visual diffs</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Start dev server: npm run dev

    2. Verify services listing page:
       - Navigate to http://localhost:3000/services
       - Confirm 2-column grid displays all 10 services
       - Click category pills and verify filter works
       - Check URL updates with ?category parameter
       - Reload page with filter active, verify persists
       - Hover over category pills: verify smooth transition (300ms)
       - Hover over service cards: verify lift effect (hover:-translate-y-1)
       - Tab through pills: verify focus-visible ring appears

    3. Verify service detail pages:
       - Navigate to http://localhost:3000/services/structural-steel-design
       - Confirm hero image displays with overlay
       - Scroll down to "How This Service Works" section
       - Confirm 4-step process displays with numbered circles
       - Scroll to Related Services, confirm same-category services show
       - Hover over "View All Services" button: verify lift effect (hover:-translate-y-0.5)
       - Hover over "Back to Services" link: verify color change + underline
       - Tab through interactive elements: verify focus-visible rings

    4. Test reduced motion support:
       - Enable OS reduced motion setting OR
       - Use Chrome DevTools: Rendering > Emulate CSS media feature > prefers-reduced-motion: reduce
       - Hover over buttons/cards: verify no transforms (no lift effect)
       - Verify color transitions still work (hover states change colors)

    5. Check visual diffs:
       - Open .planning/audit/diffs/ directory
       - Review any diff images (should show minimal/no changes if baselines exist)

    6. Read verification report:
       - Open .planning/phases/08-section-polish---services/08-04-VERIFICATION.md
       - Confirm 6/6 criteria show PASS (including micro-interactions)

    7. Approve or describe issues:
       - If all looks good, type "approved"
       - If issues found, describe what needs fixing
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" or describe issues to fix</resume-signal>
