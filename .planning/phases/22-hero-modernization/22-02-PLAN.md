<objective>
Refine hero messaging and copy based on competitive research to communicate VP Associates' value proposition clearly and professionally.

Purpose: Replace generic messaging ("Structural Engineering Excellence") with specific, differentiated positioning that highlights VP Associates' Tampa Bay expertise and 30+ year history, per research findings on purpose-driven messaging.

Output: HeroStatic with refined headline, subheadline, and CTA that communicate value proposition; user approval on final messaging.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Implement headline variants with research-informed options</name>
  <files>components/HeroStatic.vue</files>
  <action>
Update HeroStatic component with refined messaging based on research recommendations:

1. Headline options (from research Priority 2):
   Add a prop to easily switch between headline variants for testing:

   Variant A - Authority focus:
   - Headline: "Trusted by Tampa Bay Since 1990"
   - Subheadline: "Over 30 years of structural engineering excellence"

   Variant B - Outcome focus:
   - Headline: "Structures That Stand the Test of Time"
   - Subheadline: "Precision structural engineering for Tampa Bay and beyond"

   Variant C - Local focus:
   - Headline: "Tampa Bay's Structural Engineers"
   - Subheadline: "Comprehensive structural design, inspection, and detailing services"

   Variant D - Capability focus:
   - Headline: "Precision Structural Engineering"
   - Subheadline: "Licensed professionals delivering quality since 1990"

2. CTA options (from research Priority 5):
   Replace generic CTAs with specific, action-oriented options:
   - "Let's Talk" (conversational, personal)
   - "Start Your Project" (action-oriented)
   - "Tell Us About Your Project" (specific)

3. Component implementation:
   Add props for easy variant switching:
   ```typescript
   interface HeroProps {
     variant?: 'authority' | 'outcome' | 'local' | 'capability'
     headline?: string  // Override variant headline
     subheadline?: string  // Override variant subheadline
     ctaText?: string
     ctaLink?: string
     backgroundImage?: string
     showCta?: boolean
   }

   const defaultCopy = {
     authority: {
       headline: "Trusted by Tampa Bay Since 1990",
       subheadline: "Over 30 years of structural engineering excellence"
     },
     outcome: {
       headline: "Structures That Stand the Test of Time",
       subheadline: "Precision structural engineering for Tampa Bay and beyond"
     },
     local: {
       headline: "Tampa Bay's Structural Engineers",
       subheadline: "Comprehensive structural design, inspection, and detailing"
     },
     capability: {
       headline: "Precision Structural Engineering",
       subheadline: "Licensed professionals delivering quality since 1990"
     }
   }
   ```

4. Set default to Variant A (authority focus) as it best leverages VP Associates' key differentiator (30+ years Tampa Bay expertise per research).

5. For testing, add a query param override:
   - Allow ?heroVariant=local to test variants without code changes
   - Or create a simple dev-mode variant switcher (commented out in production)

Do NOT:
- Use generic phrases like "Structural Engineering Excellence" as standalone headline
- Use "Learn More" as CTA (too generic per research)
- Include more than one CTA (single clear action)
- Make headline longer than 7 words
  </action>
  <verify>Component includes variant prop with 4 headline options; default uses authority variant</verify>
  <done>HeroStatic updated with research-informed headline variants and action-oriented CTAs</done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Hero with multiple messaging variants for testing</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Start dev server: npm run dev

2. Test each headline variant:
   - Variant A (Authority): "Trusted by Tampa Bay Since 1990"
   - Variant B (Outcome): "Structures That Stand the Test of Time"
   - Variant C (Local): "Tampa Bay's Structural Engineers"
   - Variant D (Capability): "Precision Structural Engineering"

   To test variants, temporarily change the variant prop in pages/index.vue:
   ```vue
   <HeroStatic variant="outcome" />
   ```

3. For each variant, evaluate:
   - Does the headline communicate what VP Associates does?
   - Is the messaging specific (not generic to any engineering firm)?
   - Does it highlight VP Associates' differentiators (Tampa Bay, 30+ years)?
   - Is the subheadline supportive but not redundant?
   - Is the CTA clear and action-oriented?

4. Test CTA options:
   - "Let's Talk" vs "Start Your Project" vs "Tell Us About Your Project"
   - Which feels most appropriate for professional services?

5. Consider brand alignment:
   - Which variant best matches how VP Associates positions itself?
   - Which would resonate most with target clients (architects, contractors, developers)?

6. Mobile check:
   - View each variant on mobile viewport
   - Ensure text is readable and not cramped
   - Headline should still be prominent

7. Make final selection:
   - Choose the variant that best communicates VP Associates' value
   - Consider A/B testing later if uncertain

  <resume-signal>Type "approved: [variant-letter]" (e.g., "approved: A") to confirm your choice, or suggest modifications to the copy</resume-signal>
