<objective>
Run visual comparison and QA verification for About & Team section, generate verification report with Lighthouse scores, and confirm no regressions from live site baseline.

Purpose: Final quality gate for Phase 9. Compare current implementation against Phase 1 baseline screenshots to ensure no visual regressions. Run Lighthouse audits to verify performance, SEO, and accessibility standards. Verify team photo optimization results (file sizes under 50KB). Document results in verification report with user checkpoint approval.

Output: Verification report with visual comparisons, Lighthouse scores, team photo optimization verification, and pass/fail determination for each success criterion. User approval via checkpoint before marking phase complete.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Capture current screenshots for About page</name>
  <files>pages/about.vue</files>
  <action>
    Capture screenshots of About page for visual comparison:

    1. Start dev server if not running:
       npm run dev (in background with logging)

    2. Use comparison infrastructure from Phase 2 to capture screenshots:
       - Run: node .planning/scripts/capture-screenshots.js about
       - Or use Playwright script directly if available

    3. Capture About page at multiple viewports:
       - Mobile: 375x667 (iPhone SE)
       - Tablet: 768x1024 (iPad)
       - Desktop: 1920x1080 (Full HD)
       - Save to: .planning/audit/current/about-*.png

    4. Capture specific section screenshots:
       - Company History section (stats + text + image)
       - Mission & Values (3 value cards)
       - Leadership Team (4 team member cards)
       - Certifications grid (8 badges)
       - Service Area section (map + list)
       - CTA section

    5. Ensure team photos are fully loaded before capturing:
       - Wait for network idle before screenshot
       - Verify team member images are rendered

    6. Organize screenshots by viewport and section for systematic comparison.
  </action>
  <verify>Screenshots captured in .planning/audit/current/ directory, files exist for all viewports (mobile, tablet, desktop), section screenshots captured, images are valid PNG files</verify>
