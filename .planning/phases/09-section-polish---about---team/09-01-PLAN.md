<objective>
Polish About page visual styling to match the quality of completed Phases 6-8, ensuring all content sections display with proper hierarchy, spacing, and consistent design patterns.

Purpose: The About page tells the VP Associates company story through history, mission, values, team, certifications, and service area. All structural sections exist but need visual polish to match the elevated design quality of the homepage, projects, and services pages. This plan focuses on content section styling consistency rather than team photos (handled in 09-02).

Output: Polished About page with consistent section spacing, proper visual hierarchy, styled stats in Company History, value cards in Mission & Values, certification badges grid, service area with checkmarks, and full-width CTA section.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Review and verify About page section styling consistency</name>
  <files>pages/about.vue</files>
  <action>
    Review pages/about.vue and verify all sections follow design patterns from Phases 6-8:

    1. Compare section spacing with pages/index.vue and pages/services/index.vue:
       - AppSection padding values should use "md", "lg", "xl" consistently
       - Text container classes should match pattern (container mx-auto)
       - Heading hierarchy should be consistent (h2 section titles, h3 subsections)

    2. Verify Company History section (lines 22-61):
       - Stats display (30+, 500+, 100%) should have proper font-weight and color
       - Verify aspect-[4/3] placeholder for company history image
       - If no real image exists, enhance placeholder styling with gradient

    3. Verify Mission & Values section (lines 63-105):
       - 3 value cards (Safety First, Innovation, Client Service) display properly
       - Icon containers use bg-primary/10 with consistent sizing (w-16 h-16)
       - Card styling matches Phase 8 patterns (bg-white, rounded-xl, shadow-lg, border)

    4. Verify Certifications section (lines 152-171):
       - 8 certifications display in grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4 layout
       - Each cert has icon and text in white card with shadow-md

    5. Verify Service Area section (lines 173-197):
       - aspect-square placeholder for map/image
       - 10 service areas in grid-cols-2 layout with checkmark icons
       - Checkmarks use mdi:check-circle with text-secondary color

    6. Verify CTA section (lines 199-216):
       - Full-width bg-primary with padding="xl"
       - Centered text with white color
       - Contact link with proper hover state

    7. Make any necessary adjustments to match Phase 6-8 patterns:
       - Consistent section padding values
       - Consistent border-radius values (rounded-xl, rounded-2xl)
       - Consistent shadow values (shadow-lg, shadow-xl, shadow-2xl)
       - Consistent color usage (primary, primary-dark, secondary)
  </action>
  <verify>npm run dev, navigate to http://localhost:3000/about, verify all sections display with consistent spacing and styling, check mobile responsiveness (use browser devtools), compare visual quality with / and /pages</verify>
  <done>About page sections display with consistent styling matching Phases 6-8, Company History stats are prominent, Mission & Values cards have proper icon styling, Certifications grid displays evenly, Service Area list shows checkmarks, CTA section has full-width primary background</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Add subtle enhancements to About page sections</name>
  <files>pages/about.vue</files>
  <action>
    Add visual enhancements to About page while maintaining design consistency:

    1. Company History stats section (lines 38-53):
       Add hover effect to stat numbers:
       - Change stat number divs to include group hover class
       - Add scale-105 on hover to stat numbers
       - Ensure transition-all duration-300 is present

    2. Mission & Values cards (lines 74-103):
       Add hover effects to value cards:
       - Add hover:shadow-xl and hover:-translate-y-1 to each card
       - Add transition-all duration-300
       - Ensure icon containers have hover:scale-110 on icons

    3. Certifications grid (lines 163-170):
       Add hover effect to certification cards:
       - Add hover:shadow-lg and hover:border-primary transition
       - Ensure transition-all duration-300

    4. Leadership Team section (lines 107-150):
       Verify TeamMember components are properly integrated
       - Ensure grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 is correct for responsive layout
       - Verify loading skeleton displays correctly (TeamMemberSkeleton)
       - Verify error state displays with retry button

    5. Add scroll reveal animations to sections (if not present):
       - Ensure animate-on-scroll prop is on AppSection components
       - This triggers useScrollReveal composable from Phase 6

    All changes should be minimal and focused on polish, not structural changes.
  </action>
  <verify>npm run dev, navigate to /about, hover over stat numbers and verify scale effect, hover over value cards and verify lift effect, hover over certification badges and verify shadow effect, scroll down and verify fade-in animations on sections</verify>
  <done>Company History stats have scale on hover, Mission & Values cards lift on hover, Certifications have enhanced shadow on hover, Leadership Team section displays TeamMember components in responsive grid, scroll animations trigger on section entry</done>
