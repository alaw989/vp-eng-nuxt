<objective>
Add subtle lift hover effects to all card components (ProjectCard, ServiceCard, TeamMember, TestimonialCard) with consistent 300ms timing. This implements MICRO-03 (card hover effects) requirement.

Purpose: Card hover effects provide visual feedback indicating interactive content and improve perceived responsiveness. Phase 22 established the group-hover pattern for coordinated parent-child hover states.

Output: All card components show subtle lift (-translate-y-1) on hover with shadow increase and consistent timing.

# Current state from codebase audit:
- ProjectCard.vue: Has `hover:shadow-2xl transition-all duration-300` (line 5) - MISSING lift
- ServiceCard.vue: Has `hover:shadow-xl transition-all duration-300` (line 4) - MISSING lift
- TeamMember.vue: Has `hover:shadow-xl transition-all duration-300` (line 2) - MISSING lift
- TestimonialCard.vue: Unknown (needs audit)
- Image hover: `group-hover:scale-105` or `group-hover:scale-110` exists on all cards
- All cards use `group` class for coordinated hover states

# Required update per research:
- Add `hover:-translate-y-1` to card root element
- Preserve existing shadow effects (hover:shadow-xl or hover:shadow-2xl)
- Keep group-hover pattern for image scaling
- Ensure duration-300 for consistency

    Update ProjectCard.vue root NuxtLink element (line 2-7):

    1. Add `hover:-translate-y-1` to the class array
    2. Verify existing classes include:
       - `group` for coordinated hover states
       - `hover:shadow-2xl` for depth effect
       - `hover:border-primary` for color feedback
       - `transition-all duration-300` for consistent timing
    3. Preserve existing `group-hover:scale-110` on image (line 19)

    Updated class should be:
    ```vue
    :class="[
      'group overflow-hidden rounded-xl bg-white border border-neutral-200
             hover:border-primary hover:shadow-2xl hover:-translate-y-1

      viewMode === 'list' ? 'flex flex-col md:flex-row' : 'block'
    ]"
    ```

    DO NOT modify image hover effects or other interactive elements.

       - `hover:shadow-xl` for depth effect
       - `hover:border-primary` for color feedback
       - `transition-all duration-300` for consistent timing
    3. Preserve existing icon and link hover effects

    Updated class should be:

<task type="auto">
  <name>Add hover lift effect to TeamMember component</name>

    Update TeamMember.vue root div element (line 2):

    1. Add `hover:-translate-y-1` to the class attribute
    2. Verify existing classes include:
       - `hover:shadow-xl` for depth effect
       - `hover:border-primary` for color feedback
       - `transition-all duration-300` for consistent timing
    3. Add `group` class to enable coordinated hover states (currently missing)
    4. Update photo hover to use group-hover: `group-hover:scale-105` (currently just `hover:scale-105`)
    5. Update contact link hover to use group-hover for coordination

    Updated class should be:
    ```vue
    class="group bg-white rounded-xl overflow-hidden border border-neutral-200
           hover:border-primary hover:shadow-xl hover:-translate-y-1
           transition-all duration-300"

  <name>Audit and add hover effects to TestimonialCard component</name>
  <files>components/TestimonialCard.vue</files>
  <action>
    1. Review TestimonialCard.vue current implementation
    2. Testimonial cards typically don't need hover effects (non-interactive content)
    3. If card is wrapped in a link or button, add hover effects
    4. If card is static content, add subtle hover effect for polish

    Current state: TestimonialCard uses `border-t-4 border-t-primary` with `shadow-lg` (line 2)

    Add subtle hover polish:
    ```vue
    class="relative bg-white rounded-xl p-8 border border-neutral-200 shadow-lg
           hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow duration-300
           border-t-4 border-t-primary"

    DO NOT add lift effect to testimonial cards (they're not clickable).
    DO NOT modify the decorative quote mark or author info layout.

  <verify>
    1. `grep "hover:shadow-xl" components/TestimonialCard.vue` returns the class

After all tasks complete, verify:
1. `npm run dev` starts without errors
2. Hover over ProjectCard: see lift + shadow increase + image scale
3. Hover over ServiceCard: see lift + shadow increase + icon/link color change
4. Hover over TeamMember: see lift + shadow increase + photo scale
5. Hover over TestimonialCard: see shadow increase (no lift - non-interactive)
6. All card hover effects use 300ms timing (no inconsistencies)
7. Reduced motion support from 18-01 plan applies to all card transforms

<success_criteria>
1. ProjectCard, ServiceCard, TeamMember all show subtle lift on hover (-translate-y-1)
2. All cards have shadow increase on hover (shadow-xl or shadow-2xl)

4. Group-hover pattern preserved for coordinated child element effects
5. TestimonialCard has appropriate hover effects (shadow only, no lift)

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/18-core-micro-interactions/18-02-SUMMARY.md` with:
- Card hover effects added (which components updated)
- Group-hover pattern verification
