<objective>
Create Featured Projects and Featured Services sections with responsive grid layouts, rich card information, and proper linking to detail pages.

Purpose: Showcase featured content prominently on the homepage with professional card layouts. Replace the current carousel approach with a static grid that displays multiple items at once for better visibility and scanning.

Output: Two new sections on homepage using ProjectCard and ServiceCard components in responsive grid layouts.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Add Featured Projects grid section to homepage</name>
  <files>pages/index.vue</files>
  <action>
    In pages/index.vue, replace the Featured Projects Carousel section with a grid layout:

    1. Replace ProjectsCarousel with static grid using ProjectCard components
    2. Use Tailwind grid: grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-8
    3. Display first 3 projects from carouselSlides data
    4. Each ProjectCard receives: title, slug, description, category, location, year
    5. Add project images from /images/projects/ if available (check image-mapping.json)
       - Map project ACF data or title to corresponding image files
       - Use srcset for responsive images
    6. Keep section header: "Featured Projects" with subtitle
    7. Keep "View All Projects" link at bottom of section

    Remove ProjectsCarousel component and related props if no longer needed.

    Project images available (from image-mapping.json):
    - steel-connect (steel-connect-640w.webp, etc.)
    - crane-lift
    - cad-drawing
    - shallowdeepfoundationdesign10
    - lowrise
    - inspection-services
    - shopdrawing

    Map these to projects by checking project title/ACF data against image filenames.

  <verify>npm run dev, navigate to http://localhost:3000, verify Featured Projects section shows 3 cards in responsive grid, cards have images/titles/categories</verify>
  <done>Featured Projects section displays 3 project cards in grid layout (1 col mobile, 2 col tablet, 3 col desktop), each card has image, title, category, description, 'View more' link</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Add Featured Services grid section to homepage</name>
  <files>pages/index.vue</files>
  <action>
    Update the Services Section in pages/index.vue:

    1. Keep existing section header and subtitle
    2. Update grid to use grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-8
    3. Display first 3 services from services computed
    4. Each ServiceCard receives: title, description, icon
    5. Add a subtle hover effect on service cards (already in ServiceCard.vue)
    6. Keep "View All Services" link at bottom

    The ServiceCard component already exists with proper styling.
    Ensure services are fetched from /api/services and sliced to 3 items.
