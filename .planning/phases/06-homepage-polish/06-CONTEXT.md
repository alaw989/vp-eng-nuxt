# Phase 6: Homepage Polish - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-05
**Status:** Ready for planning

## Phase Boundary

Fix homepage styling, layout, and functionality to match or exceed the live site. The homepage should be modernized and improved — not a pixel-perfect replica of vp-associates.com, but a better version. Work includes hero section, featured projects/services, testimonials, and visual verification against baselines.

## Implementation Decisions

### Hero Section
- **Full-width image** covering entire viewport width
- **Dark overlay** (semi-transparent scrim) for text readability
- **Single prominent CTA** button (e.g., "View Projects")
- **Subtle motion** — slow zoom, parallax on scroll, or gentle fade-in
- Desktop layout: background image with overlaid text

### Featured Content (Projects & Services)
- **Grid/masonry layout** for displaying featured items
- **3 items per category** — 3 featured projects + 3 featured services
- **Rich card information**: image, title, excerpt/description, category label, "View more" link
- **Separate sections** — "Featured Projects" and "Featured Services" as distinct sections

### Testimonials Section
- **Card grid layout** — multiple testimonials visible at once (2-3 columns)
- **Full attribution**: quote, client name, company, role/title, project reference
- **Section header** — "What Clients Say" or similar heading
- **Large decorative quote marks** for visual treatment of quote text

### Visual Comparison Approach
- **Modernized and improved** — not pixel-perfect match to live site
- **Keep current Nuxt structure** — work with existing layout, fix visual issues
- **Add missing content** — if live site has sections/content missing from rebuild, add them
- **Actively use comparison tools** — run comparison viewer for each section change, verify against Phase 1 baselines

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact spacing and typography values
- Motion implementation details (parallax, zoom, or fade-in)
- Grid column counts for responsive breakpoints
- Quote mark styling and placement
- Exact card shadow/border-radius values
