<objective>
Run visual comparison against live site baseline and execute full QA verification including pre-commit checks with Lighthouse auditing.

Purpose: Verify that all homepage polish work meets quality standards and no regressions were introduced. Compare against Phase 1 baseline screenshots and ensure build passes all pre-commit validations.

Output: Verification report documenting visual comparison results, QA check outcomes, and any issues found.

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify">
  <what-built>Complete homepage polish including hero section with parallax motion, Featured Projects/Services grid sections, and Testimonials section with quote marks</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Start dev server: npm run dev
    2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
    3. Test hero section:
       - Verify all 3 hero slides display with real images (not placeholders)
       - Check dark overlay provides sufficient text contrast
       - Scroll down to verify parallax motion is smooth
       - Test arrow navigation and dot indicators
       - Test keyboard navigation (Arrow keys, Home, End)
    4. Test Featured Projects section:
       - Verify 3 project cards display in grid
       - Check responsive layout (resize browser to mobile/tablet/desktop)
       - Click on a project card to verify link works
    5. Test Featured Services section:
       - Verify 3 service cards display in grid
       - Check responsive layout
       - Hover over cards to verify hover effect
    6. Test Testimonials section:
       - Verify testimonial cards have large quote marks
       - Check attribution includes quote, author, company, role
       - Verify responsive layout
    7. Check browser console for hydration errors or other issues
    8. Compare visually against live site at https://vp-associates.com

    Type "approved" if all checks pass, or describe issues to fix.
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" to continue to build verification, or describe specific issues to address</resume-signal>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Run build verification and pre-commit checks</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
    Execute the pre-commit validation script:

    1. Run: node scripts/pre-commit.js
    2. This will:
       - Build the project (npm run build)
       - Start preview server
       - Check for hydration errors
       - Run Lighthouse audit (if Chrome available)
       - Cleanup processes

    Note: If Chrome is not available, Lighthouse step will be skipped gracefully.

    Review the output for:
    - Build success/failure
    - Hydration errors (zero tolerance per Phase 5 context)
    - Lighthouse scores (target 85+ for all categories)
    - Any console errors during preview
  </action>
  <verify>Run node scripts/pre-commit.js and verify build passes, no hydration errors, Lighthouse scores are 85+ (if Chrome available)</verify>
  <done>Build completes successfully, no hydration errors detected, Lighthouse scores 85+ (or skipped if Chrome unavailable), no console errors during preview</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Generate visual comparison report</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
    Create a verification report documenting the homepage polish work:

    1. Create file: .planning/phases/06-homepage-polish/06-04-VERIFICATION.md

    2. Report content should include:
       - Hero section: Images verified, parallax working, contrast check
       - Featured Projects: Grid layout, card completeness, responsive test
       - Featured Services: Grid layout, icon display, responsive test
       - Testimonials: Quote marks, attribution completeness, responsive test
       - Build verification: Build status, hydration check, Lighthouse scores
       - Visual comparison: Notes comparing against vp-associates.com
       - Issues found: List any issues identified (or "No issues found")
       - Recommendations: Any follow-up work for future phases

    3. Document the comparison against baseline screenshots in .planning/audit/baselines/home/

    The report serves as completion evidence for Phase 6.
  </action>
  <verify>Read .planning/phases/06-homepage-polish/06-04-VERIFICATION.md and verify it documents all verification steps and outcomes</verify>
  <done>Verification report exists with complete documentation of hero/projects/services/testimonials sections, build results, and visual comparison notes</done>
</task>
