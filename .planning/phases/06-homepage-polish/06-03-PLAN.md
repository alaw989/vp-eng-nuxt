<task type="auto">
  <name>Enhance TestimonialCard with decorative quote marks</name>
  <files>components/TestimonialCard.vue</files>
  <action>
    Modify TestimonialCard.vue:

    1. Add large decorative quote mark:
       - Position quote icon absolutely at top-left of card
       - Use MDI icon: mdi:format-quote-open
       - Size: w-16 h-16 (64px) for prominent visual treatment
       - Color: text-primary/10 (subtle, doesn't compete with content)
       - Add pointer-events-none to prevent interaction

    2. Add role/title props to interface:
       - Add role?: string for client's job title
       - Keep existing: quote, author, company, avatar

    3. Update attribution section to display role if available:
       - Add role display between author and company
       - Style: text-xs text-neutral-500 for role

    4. Improve card styling:
       - Add shadow-lg for elevation
       - Add border-top-4 border-primary for accent
       - Ensure sufficient padding around quote text

    5. Keep existing quote text styling (italic) and avatar fallback icon

    The component already has the basic structure with quote icon, just needs enhancement for size and position.
